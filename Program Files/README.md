# üòä Deep Emotion Recognition

This project focuses on **Deep Learning-based Emotion Recognition**. Using deep neural networks and computer vision techniques, it detects human emotions from images and videos. The system leverages facial recognition with **Haar Cascade** and classifies emotions with a deep learning model.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The key components of this project include:
- Training and testing data files (`Train1.csv`, `Test_1.csv`) for deep learning model training.
- A **Haar Cascade** XML file for facial detection.
- Deep learning models stored in `.pt` files for efficient emotion recognition.

### üìÅ Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key files in this repository:

- `Emote_train.py` - Script for training the emotion detection model using the provided dataset.
- `data_load.py` - Loads the training and testing datasets (`Train1.csv`, `Test_1.csv`) for model training and validation.
- `deep_emotion.py` - The main deep learning model definition for emotion recognition.
- `deep_emotion-100-128-0.005.pt` - A trained model for emotion detection, containing learned weights and parameters.
- `deep_emotion_weights.pt` - Another set of model weights for emotion recognition.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` - Haar Cascade file used for detecting faces in the images and videos.
- `main.py` - The main script to run the emotion recognition system.
- `sentivideo.py` - Handles video processing for emotion detection in real-time video streams.
- `split_data.py` - Utility to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` - A temporary file generated by the code runner during the project.

### üìä Data Files

- `Train1.csv` - The training dataset used to train the emotion detection model.
- `Test_1.csv` - The testing dataset used to evaluate the model's performance.

### ü§ñ Deep Learning Model

The model is trained using deep learning techniques, and the following files are related to its structure and weights:
- `deep_emotion.py` - Defines the architecture of the deep learning model.
- `deep_emotion-100-128-0.005.pt` & `deep_emotion_weights.pt` - Trained models, enabling fast and accurate emotion recognition.

### üîç Facial Detection

This project uses the **Haar Cascade** algorithm for detecting faces in images and videos, ensuring that emotions are only detected from human faces. The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is key for this process.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Run the model for real-time video emotion detection**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **To retrain the model**:
    - Prepare your dataset and ensure the files `Train1.csv` and `Test_1.csv` are updated.
    - Run the training script:
      ```bash
      python Emote_train.py
      ```

## üì∑ Emotion Detection in Action

This system detects emotions from both images and video streams in real-time. With facial recognition powered by **Haar Cascade** and a robust deep learning model, it can classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise with high accuracy.

## üéØ Applications

- **Real-time emotion recognition** in video streams.
- **Emotion-based analysis** for human-computer interaction (HCI).
- **Sentiment analysis** for video-based content creation.
- **Customer behavior analysis** in marketing and sales environments.
