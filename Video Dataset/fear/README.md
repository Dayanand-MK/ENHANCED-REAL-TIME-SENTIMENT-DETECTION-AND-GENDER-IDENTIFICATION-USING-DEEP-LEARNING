# 😄 CK+ Emotion Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of facial images used for **emotion recognition** tasks. The dataset is derived from the **CK+ (Extended Cohn-Kanade)** video dataset, a well-known collection of labeled facial expressions, which is widely used for training and testing in emotion recognition models.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of labeled images of human faces depicting different emotions. These images are extracted from video sequences, with the facial expression transitioning from neutral to the target emotion.

### 📋 Available Emotion Categories

The dataset is divided into several emotion categories:
- 😄 **Happiness**
- 😡 **Anger**
- 😢 **Sadness**
- 😮 **Surprise**
- 😠 **Disgust**
- 😱 **Fear**
- 😐 **Neutral**

### 🖼️ Image Structure

Each image in this dataset is labeled with one of the emotion categories mentioned above. The images are cropped to focus on the facial area, ensuring that the facial features are prominently highlighted for emotion classification.

## 🔍 Dataset Source

The images in this dataset were sourced from the **CK+ (Extended Cohn-Kanade)** dataset, which is widely regarded for its comprehensive collection of posed and spontaneous expressions captured in video sequences. The dataset is often used in academic research and practical implementations of **facial emotion recognition**.

### 🌐 More Information on CK+:

The CK+ dataset includes 593 sequences from 123 subjects, with each video sequence depicting a facial expression transition from a neutral face to a target emotion. The final frame of each video is typically used for emotion recognition tasks.

## 🎯 Applications

This dataset is ideal for training models in:
- **Emotion Recognition** 🤖
- **Human-Computer Interaction** 🖥️
- **Sentiment Analysis** 📊
- **Behavioral Analysis** 📈
- **Facial Expression Research** 🧠

## ⚙️ Usage

1. **Download the dataset** and organize the images into folders based on the corresponding emotion labels.
2. Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization) to suit your model’s requirements.
3. Train a deep learning or machine learning model using the labeled emotion categories.
